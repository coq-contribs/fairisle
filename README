This library, developped by S.Coupet-Grimal and L.Jakubiec-Jamet from LIF, investigates
how to take advantage of the particular features of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions
in the framework of hardware verification. 

Co-inductive types are used to model the temporal aspects of sequential synchronous devices. 
Moore and Mealy automata are co-inductively axiomatized and are used to uniformly represent  
both the structures and the behaviours of circuits. This leads to clear, general and elegant 
proof processes. Our approach is hierarchical and modular. It is based
on a general lemma which states an equivalence between the two streams computed from automaton
that represents structure and the one that represents behaviour.

Moreover, we have introduced dependent types whenever they contributed to a better reliability of the 
specifications and we have shown that an heavy use of this kind of encoding  was feasible in practice.

We apply this methodology to a real circuit, the Fairisle ATM 4x4 Switch Element.
